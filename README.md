Hi I'm Tommy Schupp (he/him). I'm going to American University for Data Science for Political Science and hopefully double majoring in Computer Science.
 
I know Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, and a little bit of some other languages. Most of the projects that I have posted are related to webscraping. 

Currently learning rust!
